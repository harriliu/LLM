# 1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
[Link to my notebook](https://github.com/harriliu/LLM/blob/main/llm_projects/rag.ipynb)
- This notebook demonstrates how to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions about a given dataset of documents. RAG combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a document store. This allows RAG to answer a wider range of questions than LLMs alone, and to provide more accurate and informative answers. The notebook also demonstrates simple index search as well as elastic search (inverted index).
# 2. AI Website Summarizer
[Link to my notebook](https://github.com/harriliu/LLM/tree/main/llm_projects/AI_Web_Summarizer)
- A powerful web content summarization tool that leverages both OpenAI's GPT models and local Ollama models to generate concise summaries of web pages. This dual-model approach provides flexibility between cloud-based and local summarization options.
# 3. AI Business Brochure Generator
[Link to my notebook](https://github.com/harriliu/LLM/tree/main/llm_projects/AI_Business_Brocchure_generator)
- An automated tool that generates professional company brochures by intelligently analyzing website content using GPT models. The generator crawls company websites, identifies relevant pages, and creates engaging brochures with customizable tone and language.
