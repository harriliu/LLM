# 1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
[Link to my notebook](https://github.com/harriliu/LLM/blob/main/llm_projects/rag.ipynb)
- This notebook demonstrates how to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions about a given dataset of documents. RAG combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a document store. This allows RAG to answer a wider range of questions than LLMs alone, and to provide more accurate and informative answers. The notebook also demonstrates simple search as well as elastic search.
